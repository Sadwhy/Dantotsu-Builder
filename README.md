## Annoyances

1. **Manual Build Triggers**  
   Major updates can be triggered manually if needed.  (by me)
2. **Different Signatures**  
   This build uses different signing keys from the official version. As a result:
   - You cannot install both versions simultaneously.  
   - Installing one prevents the other from updating.  
3. **No Empty Releases**  
   Builds are skipped if there are no new commits during the week.

## Changes in This Build

- **Performance Optimization**  
  Debugging and Firebase are disabled for improved performance.  
- **Comments Feature**  
  A [PR](https://github.com/rebelonion/Dantotsu/commit/d1e2ca8b5e71cc4e58d3a1201981001cb11fb78a) enables toggleable comments.  
  By default, comments are **off**, so there is no connection to the comments API unless enabled.  

### How to Disable Comments:
1. Visit your [**Anilist settings**](https://anilist.co/settings/apps).  
2. Revoke Dantotsu's access if previously used.  
3. Log in within the app.
